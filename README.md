## Dataset Description
The dataset contains credit card transaction records including both genuine and fraudulent transactions.  
It is a **highly imbalanced dataset**, which makes fraud detection a challenging task.

- `Class = 0` → Genuine Transaction  
- `Class = 1` → Fraudulent Transaction  
## Data Science Workflow
